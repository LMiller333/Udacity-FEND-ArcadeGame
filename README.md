# Classic Arcade Game Clone (for Udacity FEND Nanodegree)

This is a modified version of the classic arcade game "Frogger." Although the example from Udacity showed the bugs as the enemies, I decided to flip the paradigm a bit and show the human as the enemy that the bug needs to dodge. 

## Getting Started

You are the bug, and you are trying to cross the road to enjoy a nice swim in the lake. Use your arrow keys to cross the road, but be careful! There are many boys walking (and running) across the road and they will squish you. 

## Built With

* JavaScript game engine & assets (provided by Udacity)
* Audio files from Mativve and HonorHunter

## In Development

Upcoming features include levels with increased difficulty, more player stats, and the ability to choose your player.
